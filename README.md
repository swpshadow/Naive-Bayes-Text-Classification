# Naive-Bayes-Text-Classification

Project 1 for Machine Learning graduate level class at University.

Naive Bayes text classifier for DrugLib data set found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Druglib.com%29#

The file location for reading should be changed according to actual location on machine. 

Output will indicate after each data set is trained then the results of testing with Multinomial and Bernouli Naive Bayes classifiers. The output of the results will contain a list of the probabilities that the input sentence belongs to each of classifications. Due to the subjective nature of the reviews and the large range of the scores, the probabilities will not be extremely accurate.

This code can be adapted to other data sets, however the reading of the data is specific to only this data set. Other changes may need to be made as well to ensure correct formating of input.
